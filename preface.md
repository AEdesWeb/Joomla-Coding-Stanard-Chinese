# Preface

讓一個軟體變得更好的因素，並不只在於其提供了多少優異的功能，而在於他的原始碼品質有多優良。為了在競爭激烈的開源環境與專有軟體中佔有一席之地，原始碼不只需要優美的結構設計，更需要在閱讀上看起來同樣美麗而優雅。

Readable code is maintainable code and the compass that guides us in achieving that goal is a set of well thought out coding standards for the different software languages that are employed in our software project. Joomla has a solid heritage of striving to support a great looking product with great looking code. This document compiles the collective wisdom of past and present contributors to the project to form the definitive standard for coding in Joomla, whether that is for the core Joomla Framework or an extension that forms part of the stack of the Joomla CMS. It also serves as a lighthouse to the Joomla developer community, to safely guide developers around the pitfalls of becoming lackadaisical with respect to writing clean, beautiful code.

The Joomla Coding Standards borrows heavily from the PEAR coding standard for PHP files, augmenting and diverging where it is deemed sensible to do so.
